        <div><p>Sometimes you need a sugar overdose in the morning.  No better way to do this than a bowl of Fruit Loops!</p></div>
        <div>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fruit Loops - Kellogs (I'm am not a sponsor, I jsut love Fruit Loops)</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Sugar addiction</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Fight the urge to go back to sleep and get yourself up and out of bed.  Yes we all agree school/work sucks and sleep is better.</li>
            <li>While rubbing the sleep out of your eyes, stumble into your kitchen.  Don't trip over your clothes you haphazardly tossed onto the floor before going to bed the night before.</li>
            <li>Reach into the kitchen cabnets and grab yourself a bowl and your trusty spoon.</li>
            <li>Grab the Fruit Loops you left on the table from the morning prior.  Check to make sure they're not stale.</li>
            <li>Pour as much as you like into your bowl.  If you use the last bit, set yourself a reminder to pick up more after work.  If you're still in school, text your mom/dad to pick some more up after work.</li>
            <li>Add in your milk.  I like my Fruit Loops crunchy throughout the experience so I use a little less than recommended.  Play with this until you find <strong>YOUR</strong> sweet spot.</strong></li>
            <li>Go to town!</li>
        </ol>
